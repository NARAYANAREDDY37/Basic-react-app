Here, you can see the basic difference between Real DOM and Virtual DOM. 

Click the below link to see how virtual DOM renders. Please try to enter something in the input fields and notice the difference. 

In the second input field you could type something and it remains there. But in the first input field you could enter but It is rendered every second.
